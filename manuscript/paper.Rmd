# Introduction {#sec:intro}
We wanted to look at how the choice of k in k-fold cross validation affected the estimation of the prediction error. 

Literature review.

# Simulation Study
This is how you cite a paper: @R2022language

Simulations were performed using the R programming language (@R2022language).  

Describe simulation studty with LASSO.

# Results
We find blah blah

#Conclusions 
Early work found this.  More recent work found this.  Our work confirms that.  We suggest........ 

Future work?  What else would we like to do?
